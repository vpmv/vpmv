# Usage

`/usr/bin/vpmv start|stop|mount|sleep [operand]`

## RTFM

`man vpmv`

# But seriously

I spend most of the time here browsing sources for my full-time job. 

It seems that the time I spend productively, is on code I don't even support anymore. My Unchained CMS for example; I'd much rather have dedicated apps for easily managing my activities, but Unchained is just good enough for now. A few simple tweaks and we're good to go. 
You should give it a try, but I don't recommend it for production environments anymore.
