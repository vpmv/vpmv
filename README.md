# Code, rinse, repeat

```go
import (
  "time"
  "math/rand"
)

func main() {
  for {
    t := time.Now().Hour()
    switch {
    case t > 8 && t < 18:
      work()
    case t >= 18 && t <= 23:
      freetime()
    }
    time.Sleep(3600 * time.Second)
  }
}

func work() {
  tasks := []string{"code", "read", "discuss"}
  log.Println(tasks[rand.Intn(len(tasks))])
}

func freetime() {
  tasks := []string{"sit in garden", "listen to music", "horse around"} # i don't eat
  log.Println(tasks[rand.Intn(len(tasks))])
}
```
# But seriously

I spend most of the time here browsing sources for my full-time job.<br>
I'm mostly proficient in GoLang & PHP. Front-end isn't my strong suit, but I manage.

My online actions are not a representation of my being, skills or capabilities. I know the code above may well just be a cronjob, don't worry &#128521;.
